## Homework week 4

Chose a font, which took entirely too long to do. I think I made this assignment harder than it had to be for me. I put it above the root in the CSS.

Picture of the questions when they begin, theres a tracker bar, a score bar and a list of questions pulled from the Array.

If the selection the user makes is not correct it turns red, if its correct it turns green, after the color change it moves to next question and updates the score.

The questions are worth 100 each, at the end the best score the user can get is 400.

If for whatever reason the user wanted to go through this again, they can just click the play again.
